## Structure

[](Key message - waiting for code to run is a pain.  How do we 
make it quicker?)


* Two parts:
  	* Optimising code (may not _need_ to go down HPC route)
	* HPC at UoM

* HPC facilities at UoM
	* ref George's talk on iCSF
	* Focus on using the CSF; batch jobs

* MS R Open - may not need to go down the HPC route

* Code optimisation

## Picture of people getting bored waiting for code to run

##  Optimising code

* Most PCs have 2, 4 or 8 cores.  
  	* R will only use one of these by default
* Two approaches to using more of them:
  	* Explicitly parallise code
	* Use a version of R with libraries that use > 1 core

## Microsoft R Open

* [MS R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open/) uses optimised versions of
  [BLAS and LAPACK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl).
  	* Typically quicker even on a single thread
	* Even quicker if we use multiple threads
* Speed up will depend on _what_ you're doing
  	* Linear algebra
